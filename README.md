Cybot hacked to be controlled via an Arduino Uno

I built on work [here](http://www.lpilsley.co.uk/cybot/driver.htm).  
I shall provide pictures and documentation later.  
The eventual plan is to be controlling the robot's servo and sonar modules  
via an Arduino Uno. A stretch goal is to have IR communication between the   robot and a raspberry pi or other device.  
At the moment only servo control is done.
